## Project Background:
This project was from Lambda School's building week. Our team helped a weeding planner to create a platform, which can show off his amazing pictures and personal information.

## Project MVP Requirements:
This app contains two user types. A wedding planner (who has the ability to log in) and a single user (no need to log in so no need for user data to be persisted on this user type) who can view portfolios.

* Onboarding process for wedding planner. Include their location and contact info for people to reach them.
* Login Page - After a user logs in, they'll be directed to their portfolio page where they can view what they have posted. They can also click to edit or delete posts.
* Navigation - Navigation is present on all pages, Users should know what page is active by clicking on a nav link and activating their tab.
* Create Post Page - Allows a user to come in and create a post of a wedding. Each post needs to have an image, description, wedding location, wedding theme, and list of vendors they managed. (You can hard code the image in for MVP-no need to upload photos for MVP. Stretch goals will include image uploading and the use of Cloudinary API etc. )
* Home Page for non-logged in users - Navigating to the home page Users can view posts of different wedding planners laid out in a single format. Users can click on a single post to read more of the description etc. They can filter by planner name, location, or theme.
